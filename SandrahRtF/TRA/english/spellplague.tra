@1    = ~Your time is over, you're on the wrong side these days, my dear.~
@2    = ~You're judging prematurely, it is your god who has lost the powers that the Weave and Mystra had to let him participate in.~

@5    = ~Bow or die!~
@6    = ~Such activities were to be expected.~

@15   = ~If this is so, then Mystra is alive.~
@16   = ~Your priestess is no longer travelling with you?~
