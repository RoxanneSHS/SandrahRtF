@1681 = ~Shauhana's Bow

Shauhana, the half-orc girl you once rescued from her own Clan in the Stormhorns, later became the ruler and queen of the northern Clan Orcs. As a daughter of the god Arvoreen she is the only female part-orc you have ever heard of to have any magic abilities. The origin of her bow is mysterious as it is clearly not orcish. Shauhana gave the weapon to the stepson she and her husband Minsc had adopted.
The bow requires no arrows but spits out salves of magical arrows when used, making him a kind of one-man army against large groups of foe.~
@1682 = ~Isobel is called *Izzy* by everyone who knows her despite some early attempts by the orphanage and later her foster parents to make her use her real name.
Well, her foster parents...Izzy was among the very first children to come to the Orphanage at Beregost which was founded by Imoen the Magnificent and Henning of Nashkel. When Imoen finally retired after the adventuring days with <CHARNAME> and Sandrah she returned to the Sword Coast and settled down at the large mansion she owned. Izzy and Imoen were considered soon by all as mother and daughter and it did not take long until it was made official with Izzy's adoption.
The red headed and quick witted youngster learned her mother's spells as easily as she became the threat to every lock around town.
Her foster parents became aware that they would not be able to keep their eldest in the house for much longer after her seventeenth birthday as she was nurtured on the adventuring stories of Imoen the Magnificent from her early days onwards. They surely would not let her go with just any adventuring party passing through town - but when <CHARNAME> in person appeared one day returning to the Realms once again to fight against evil, there was no way of holding Izzy in the house just one day longer...~
@1683 = ~When you see the stately ranger today it is hard to recognize the little street rat from Beregost you once met in your early adventuring days. Seeking shelter with his uncle in Amn he was instead captured by slavers and sold to the orcs in the Stormhorns. When Shauhana finally united the Clans and the new age began for the orcs he was freed by her but having no place else to go he stayed with Minsc and Shauhana who raised them as their son. In Minsc's Clan Orc Berserkers Lodge he learned from his heroic stepfather, while his mother taught him to use her famous magic bow. Like any good ranger he has his small animal companion, a female hamster descendent of the most famous Boo - aka Boolerion - whom he has named Boola.~

@1695 =~During a visit to the Waterdeep Temple Sandrah has once rescued an infected young girl from a painful death. With a blood transfusion using <CHARNAME>'s blood she saved Leyala's life.
Leyala stayed at the temple and was educated by Mystra's priests. She concentrated on learning a monk's skills. When <CHARNAME> became the God of Love and Hope, she dedicated her life and faith to the one whose blood runs in her veins and became a nun of the new god. With her charisma and example she won new followers for her god easily.

It ends dramatically with the heroes sacrificing their own lives to push the God of Murder into the abyss for all eternity.~
@1762 =~Cerameon's Journal~
@1763 =~The personal memories of the great Defender of Westgate are an inspiring lecture for her descendant Sandrah who shows many similarities to her ancestress. 
The part that is of most interest to you at this time however is the chapter dealing with the infiltration of the Realms by Thayan wizards to supply the aggressor troupes. Through magically created tunnels they supplied magic devices and summoned monsters from the East to strategic points in the Realms. The main exit portal was located in a place that later became the site of the monastery of Ravencrest. Cerameon had to sacrifice her right hand holding her famous hammer in the act to seal this portal.
In the personal entry following this loss, the heroine also mentions the fact that the portal could have been used to travel to Thay within a single day. The hammer used to seal the gate is also the only key to open it again hence she required it to be buried with her forever after her death.~

Your initial mission to prevent a conflict between the Clan Orcs of Shauhana and the Southern Towns has been successful. Nevertheless it becomes apparent that your mission on Faerun has just begun.

Some possible opponents have shown their faces for a short moment while others are still hidden. 

Your lover and counsellor Sandrah, the goddess at your side, has proposed to inquire ancient sources of lore to gain more information. She has suggested to visit her grandmother Midnight, the retired Mystra, in Waterdeep. Another trip should lead you to your former home, the library of Candlekeep.~
@1765 =~You first encountered the over-ambitious sorcerer in the form of a talking chicken during your early Sword Coast adventures. The apprentice of Thalantyr had made attempts with spells far beyond his skills and could only be restored with yours and his masters help. The lesson learned from that did not seem to have lasted long.
Melicamp has travelled the Realms for some time now and has worn out several tutors on his trail. He has a natural talent for the arcane but lacks the patience and concentration to make full use of his skills at times. Maybe he will listen to Sandrah to advance in his art.
By the way - Sandrah. Melicamp started his career in Waterdeep where the youngster fell in love with a young student priestess of Mystra...the quicksilver temper of both did not let this early attempt at romance last long. But both may have matured since then.~

The phalanx of our opponents becomes visible part by part - and each new face adds to our disturbance. Cyric and Talos, our old enemies, are involved same as the Arch-Lich Velsharoon. The goddess Shar, goddess of the dark and the Shadow Weave, might as well play a role. 

Behind all however is a creature of the Prime, a mortal, or better to say undead, pulling the strings -
Szass Tam, the High Zulkir of Thay whom we had encountered long ago in Sharkta Fai.

One thing has become clear, we need to leave our known grounds as the answers lie to the far unknown east of Faerun, in Thay.~

With the destruction of Xephistagoras and his academy of spellcasters we have dealt the phalanx of our enemies the first crucial blow. The mages were used to draw as much magical energy from the Weave at one time as possible, in order to weaken the Goddess of All Magic significantly when her support was most needed. 

We have discovered that this part of our enemies' operations was the responsibility of the Storm Lord Talos. After our success, the Overlord AO himself forbids any further involvement of Talos in the current challenge.

Sandrah used the moment to request AO to make Talos' ban from the Primary Plane a permanent one. I hope she has not over stepped her demands here and angered AO against us.

Still, even with Talos and Xephistagoras gone, our opponents stay strong and we will consult Midnight at Waterdeep to find out how we probably may neutralise another member of the phalanx.~

She has cleverly pointed out the threat coming from Velsharoon and Szass Tam towards the power of Kelemvor's dominion. She is sure that the god will act very soon against his unwanted competitors thus providing a second front that our enemies now have to face.

Almost alone. Sandrah's faithful servant Pelligram has given up her disguise and come to your side to aid in this dark hour. And help is what you need now.

You can only anticipate what your own private loss may mean for Faerun and even for the other planes. With the True Weave under control of Shar, the Lady of Loss has now control over all magic - or at least she thinks she has. The death of Mystra will cause a spell plague in the near future - the power of all gods who depend on the Weave is in peril, including your own.

Pelligram has reminded you of some words Sandrah had left for you shortly before and maybe in anticipation of her fate. You are to retrieve some insignia of Mystra and bring them to Midnight in Waterdeep together with some unknown element that according to Sandrah *will find me*.~

I hold Sandrah in my arms again!!

Mystra and her Chosen, Pelligram and Larloch, have fooled everyone including myself. In fact, my belief in her killing by Shar and my despair over it were part of the ploy. They have staged the whole Spell Plague to cut off our enemies' phalanx from their magic resources and to weaken the Shadow Weave. At the same time pressure is put on the alliance of our foe and cracks begin to show as tension between them grows, each one shifting blame to the other and anticipating betrayal.

But my companion has more in mind than just winning the current battle. The Spell Plague has caused already many gods of the Pantheon a significant loss in influence, power and followers on our home plane, the Prime. Sandrah sees a chance in this development - the mortals will seek out other resources to compensate for the loss of magic. Thus science and inventions will become more important, knowledge and wisdom will replace blind faith.

For the time being Sandrah, my love, is alive while Mystra stays hidden, considered dead by many.

Sandrah has made a promise to herself, her sister and her home plane that the current crisis will be the last time the gods will use Faerun as the playground for their endless quarrels. She never forgot our own suffering as mortals from the whims of the celestials.

In the end she had accepted the role of a goddess for just that purpose - to emancipate the mortals from the reign of the gods.~

@1941 =~The Vaunted's End

Our earlier visit to Kelemvor, the God of the End of Everything, has produced its result today. Kelemvor has reacted to Velsharoon's activities to help in the production of undead creatures in support of Szass Tam's armies. The dead souls misused by the Necromancer are claimed by Kelemvor as belonging to his realm and their undead persistence on the Primary Plane unbalances the order of the planes.

In a battle at the old Firewine bridge Velsharoon has been defeated with the little help our party could provide. 

Sandrah's assessment to use Kelemvor as an unofficial supporter to our quest was correct and another member of the enemy phalanx has thus be eliminated.

For us it becomes now time to return to Thay for the final confrontation with the remaining opponents, Shar, Cyric - and Szass Tam.~

@1946 =~The Citadel

The Citadel was already carved into the peak of one of the highest mountains in the Thay Mount when the first humans explored this strange and marvellous region shortly after Netheril's fall. The identity of the place's original owners has been lost in the swirls of time, but murals and carvings found in its lowest halls depict an advanced lizardfolk civilization destroyed so long ago as to be forgotten.

It is possible that the lizardfolk of the Surmarsh are descendants of this ancient people, but if so, their fall from grace was particularly hard. The primitive lizardfolk would not have the first idea how to go about creating such an amazing place.

The Citadel has long been off-limits to the Thayan people. Foreigners are not even supposed to be told of its existence. In earlier years, the Red Wizards sent expeditions into the place to explore as much of it as they could. Some returned with treasure, including gold, artwork, and even powerful magic items. However, more often than not, the parties of explorers never returned at all. 

One of the more successful ventures retrieved a tome that describes the lower levels of the Citadel in detail - A portion of the place, known as the Paths of the Doomed, is a maze of tunnels occupied by all sorts of monsters but also is said to contain artefacts of ancient craft and knowledge and a large amount of tomes revealing the knowledge and spellcraft of the Citadel's original inhabitants.

Zulkir Szass Tam has confiscated all books found in the Citadel for his own studies, and few outside of his direct circle of peers have ever actually seen any, much less read from them. It is however clear that Szass Tam in this way has access to the most ancient and powerful arcane knowledge existing on the Primary Plane.~

Cyric named the sword "Godsbane" because while he was a mortal, he used it to slay Bhaal (then Lord of Murder), and after becoming a deity, he used it to kill Leira, Lady of Deception.
The soon-to-become Prince of Lies also used it to kill Kelemvor Lyonsbane while atop Blackstaff Tower to usurp his place at the heroine Midnight's side and in her bed.
Even without Mask's presence inside the weapon it is powerful enough in Cyric's hands as he has gained the portfolio of intrigue, along with shadowy characteristics. For this, Mask hates Cyric, and he continuously plots ways to recover his lost portfolio.~

Only the Great Puppeteer who pulled all the strings in this play has made his usual escape from the battlefield. 
Cyric, the Prince of Lies, has not yet accepted his failure and the ban from the Primary Plane decreed by the Overlord.

The mad god still tries to get the Bhaal essence he thinks you possess to rule the throne of the god of murder. To blackmail you and Sandrah he has kidnapped his former lover, Sandrah's grandmother Midnight.

What appeared to be a large power struggle between old and new Gods over the Realms and the Pantheon has finally found its - unexpected - end.

Those deities who have plotted against Mystra and me have been defeated and are banned from the Prime for all times by the Overlord. 
In hindsight it appears that they have all been tools used to establish a new order in Celestia and on Faerun.

Sandrah has staged Mystra's death and the spell plague to permanently reduce the impact of the gods on the mortals. She even used the Overlord AO himself to play his lines and made him punish the aggressors.

Sandrah expects that the influence of the Gods will start to vanish over the next decades and centuries. The mortals of the Prime will soon realize their chance to shape their existence more freely - magic will make room for science, inventions will replace magical items provided by the celestials.

The mortal Sandrah had accepted her role as a Goddess to emancipate the mortals from being the toys of a bunch of selfish and irresponsible gods. 

This will remain the legacy of Mystra - or shall I say Sandrah of Waterdeep?~

After the victorious defeat of Menzoberranzan's two year siege of Ust Natha, the city became a beacon of hope and resistance for many drow, the example that life outside of Lolth's deadly shadow was possible. The city closed all temples and was the first in Faerun that had a society free of all religions, based on logic, rules and science.
When L'Urieet succeeded matron Imrae - one of the few drow rulers to die of a natural death after a long life - she established friendly contacts with Undermountain but without letting Eilistraee's faith infiltrate her domain.

Some disturbing news about Izzy's *half-sister* Sharlenia and her boyfriend Rhobald - the pair has made it to Bezantur in Thay but obviously have got into trouble with one of the most powerful and dangerous men in this town, Samas Kul.
He seems to be a man we will have to face in our mission anyway sooner or later...~
@2049 =~Clones and an old *Friend*

The visit to Irenicus has provided a number of interesting insights.

First - Our old enemy #1 has turned into a scientific researcher - and a family man, obviously father to little Quayle and soon-to-be husband of no other than the flying elf Aerie. He was helpful but obviously not involved in the plot against me and Mystra.
Second - The knowledge to produce Clones in large quantity requires very ancient knowledge and the access to those old sources. The red wizards as well as the names Halruaa and Nesseril were mentioned by Irenicus and Sandrah.
Third - The only trail left to follow is that of Nerkio, alias The Collector. Either some Shadow Thief Fence or some graveyard may be a point to start inquiries about him.~
@2050 =~Clones and an old *Friend*

We found a promising hint as to where *The Collector* may be found. There is an ancient graveyard at Waterdeep just east of Mystra's Temple which has a connection to Halaster's old catacombs in Undermountain. Several conditions make it the ideal place for the activities of our target.~

Wallrick, the adjutant of Shauhana, has reached us with alerting news. The Vaunted lich Velsharoon and his undead army have attacked the conference at the summer camp. Our friends and allies are trapped somewhere at the lower levels of the camp while the lich controls the surface and upper regions. How long Shauhana, Shar-Teel and the others can defend their position is unclear - we need to hurry to their rescue urgently while Wallrick will organise an orc attack against Velsharoon's thralls on the surface.~
@2056 =~A Phalanx of Foe

We have defeated an attack of the Lich-Lord Velsharoon on our mortal friends. Taking into account this and some other recent events it seems that a large assembly of enemies has forged an alliance against Mystra and the Deity of Love and Hope I have become.
Aside from Velsharoon, there is Talos playing a role, obviously Cyric, but also mortal players like the red wizards of Thay now in league with the cowled wizards expelled from Athkatla.
Sandrah is sure that we have not yet discovered the names of all involved.
What is clear, however, is that we need to act fast and our next step is a journey to Ravencrest, south of Amkethran.~
@2057  = ~The Seal To Thay

We have found the Seal that Sandrah's ancestress Cerameon has once closed with her hammer and sacrificing her right hand to achieve it. It seems the only way to open it again is with that famous hammer itself which was buried with its owner.
The grave of the famous heroine is at Mornbryn's Shield on the River Surbrin - a small village between Eversuit and Teziir.~
@2058  = ~The Seal To Thay

@2059  = ~L'Urieet and Lolth

The Drow goddess Lolth cannot allow any drow to escape from her regime. It would encourage others, it would be an example that the fear by which she holds the dark elves enslaved can be overcome.
My companion L'Urieet has encountered an unpleasant visit from the Spider Queen's representative but our joint forces have driven the assassin away. It is to be feared that this visit may not be the last of its kind. Lolth will attempt to catch L'Urieet and judge her in the Underdark.~

@2060 =~Journey to Thay

We have passed the ancient seal and used a transport system as old as Netheril to travel into the heart of Thay. Our journey has brought us to an old temple located below the city of Bezantur.~

@2061 =~A Helping Hand

In an operating manual for the ancient transport system between Thay and the Sword Coast we found an important hint. Two things are required to activate the system. One is a Symbol of Velsharoon, one of which we found with Sarevok at Candlekeep - the other is the right hand of the *master* to touch the scales. Sandrah assumes that the master meant here is no other than the Thayan Ruler and Red Wizard Lich Szass Tam, the creature of the Prime we suspect to be the *(im)mortal* mastermind behind the intrigue against us.
It may need quite some persuasion to have Szass Tam touch the scales of the transporter in our presence...~
@2062 =~Journey to Thay

Some information we have gathered so far about Thay
Neither Mystra nor myself, <CHARNAME> of Love and Hope, are deities worshipped here. Cyric has become powerful recently and also Mask. The Waterbitch is worshipped in Thay as well as Tempus - but most power lies within the Red Wizards themselves and especially old arcane knowledge controlled by their most important representative - Szass Tam.
There is an opposition however, the Red Hoods. One of Mystra's chosen, a woman named Candrella, is in their ranks. Sandrah claims that the Red Hoods may soon learn about our presence and will seek our contact.
We should stay incognito and explore the town thoroughly.~
@2063 =~Journey to Thay

One name that has come up already multiple times during our short stay in Bezantur is that of our old acquaintance Edwin Odesseiron. He - or rather his family - seems to play a special role in this town and thereby probably also in the current proceedings we are involved in. Whether he will turn up as friend or foe during our stay remains to be seen.~
@2064 =~Working for the Shadow Thieves Again

The guild of Shabella the Pale in Bezantur has knowledge through their protector Mask about mine and Sandrah's identity. They promise to respect our incognito as long as we co-operate with them. Our task is to retrieve two artefacts of Mask from a man named Samas Kul, the Leader of the Guild of Foreign Trade. This guild resides in a highly protected compound in the Eastern Harbour which will not be easily accessible.~
@2065 =~Elite Guardian~
@2066 =~Giran's Quest

Right in the heart of Thay, Giran has spotted a little clan orc boy scouting. When we followed the trace, we overheard a conversation of slavers obviously intending to capture and enslave some Clan Orc party which may have left the Stormhorns for whatever reason and made it to the boundary between Thay and Rashemen.~
@2067 =~Giran's Quest

Giran told us that not all Clan Orcs were happy to follow his mother's reign in the Stormhorns. Gathlenk's son Nildjek some time ago has left Clan Orc land with a group of such Orcs to find a new home somewhere else. It may be those renegades that are now endangered.
Even if those Orcs may be at odds with Shauhana, Giran considers them kin and not to be left in the hands of Thayan slavers. We may get a chance to intervene but I also cannot endanger our own mission.~
@2068 =~Giran's Quest

The trace to the missing Orcs leads to the border area between Thay and Rashemeen which is accessible from the north eastern edge of the Foreign Trade Guild area.~
@2069 =~Journey to Thay

The way to the Red Hoods leads through the mausoleum on the Odesseiron estate - a strange coincidence, if it really is one. We received part of a key from Candrella but the second part is in the hand of the enemy, this time the almighty Autharch and Legion Commander Ithrash. He has confiscated the item we need and probably inspects it in the Court Building or some other forbidden area.~
@2070 =~Green Slime King~
@2071 =~The Cloak of Mask is the perfect item for a thief. The former owner should have put an enchantment for backstab. He his no longer breathing air and the cloak has a new owner. Such as life of a thief in a guild.

STATISTICS:

Special:  Non-detectable by magical means such as detect invisibility and scrying.~
@2072 =~Cloak of Mask~
@2073 =~Working for the Shadow Thieves Again

We have regained the Cloak of Mask, one of the items that Shabella the Pale needs us to retrieve.~
@2074 =~Working for the Shadow Thieves Again

We have regained a Sword of Mask, one of the items that Shabella the Pale needs us to retrieve.~
@2075 =~A Phalanx of Foe

Our meeting with Trademaster Samas Kul has given us a number of new details about our situation in Thay and the phalanx we face on the Prime.
Szass Tam plays a key role, just like we already suspected, even if not all of Thay supports him. Shar, Talos, Cyric, Velsharoon and the cowled wizards have all been confirmed to be part of the plot. And another old enemy has turned up again - Xephistagoras.
Sandrah is quite concerned about his involvement as it seems that he has established himself directly on the Sword Coast. In the old Bhaal temple of the Black Hand he is reported to assemble hundreds of mages and sorcerers to draw power from the Weave - this way being able to weaken Mystra on command.~
@2076 =~Working for the Shadow Thieves Again

All items required by Shabella are now in our possession. To deliver them, means to remove the threat of our de-masking in Thay. Nevertheless, I am well aware that it is probably a trap of the Shadow Thieves that awaits us.~
@2077 =~Journey to Thay

Light at the end of the tunnel and a big surprise.
We have finally met the leader of the Red Hoods and Candrella's husband - it is no other than Edwin Odesseiron.
After his return from the Sword Coast and Amn some years ago he found himself a wanted man in Thay and his family extinguished by Szass Tam's regime. Instead of a wealthy life at the head of his family he found himself an outlaw. He was met by Candrella and Colano and soon found a new career with the Red Hoods who were in need of leadership at that time.
The liberation of Thay however is only possible with our common enemy Szass Tam out of the way. The Zulkir has unlimited resources and magical powers from his mysterious *Citadel*. 
We are not yet ready to strike and face Szass Tam directly. Instead, we need to weaken the phalanx of his allies and at the same time find some powerful supporters for our own side. To achieve both, we need to return to the Sword Coast at this time.The Red Hoods will arrange for our journey back. We are to meet our allies in a private back room at Sharkey's in town.~

@2079 =~A Phalanx of Foe

Several tasks lie ahead of us once we are back on the Sword Coast.
One is to eliminate Xephistagoras at the old Bhaal temple in the Wood of Sharp Teeth.
Second is to consult with Midnight at Waterdeep on a plan Sandrah is currently developing.
Third is to find and encourage some own allies who are able and determined to neutralise one or other of Szass Tam's conspirators.~
@2080 =~Leyala's Quest

Leyala has wed two elves who cannot be more different in character but still bound together by the power of love - Joneleth Irenicus, the former Exile, and the Avariel Aerie.
Further tasks for your little ambassador of love may lay ahead in near future, just think of the old bastard-gone-soft Saemon and his black pearl Shaleij...~
@2081 =~A Phalanx of Foe

The picture of whom we have to face in this intrigue has become a little clearer by now. With Sandrah's and Midnight's help and lore we are now able to start planning on how to oppose the phalanx.
- Talos has been suspended by AO himself after we eliminated his puppet Xephistagoras.
- Velsharoon's activities are despised most of all by Kelemvor , once Kelemvor Lyonsbane in mortal life and Midnight's former lover, now the God of the Death. He is a candidate for an ally. Midnight will use her old connections to contact him.
- The best weapon against a Lich is a Lich, the weapon against a Lich of the calibre of Szass Tam is hard to find, but Larloch, the Shadow King, may be capable - and he is a follower of Mystra, still.
- Shar is the foe my companion Sandrah, alias Mystra, has to face herself.
- Cyric, well, we need to see about him. His hatred against his granddaughter and Mystra is as deep as his hatred against the one who *stole* Bhaal's essence.~
@2082 =~Leyala's Quest

We - respectively Leyala - have received a call for help. The shadow thieves of Athkatla are worried about their Boss Saemon. His lovely Shaleij seems to be missing for a couple of days already. As none of the thieves dares to intrude into Saemon's private life, they count on my nun to be able to solve whatever issue exists between the two.
Leyala asks me to accompany her to the docks to find out more.~
@2083 =~Leyala's Quest

She is as smart as she is beautiful - my little nun Leyala is a true detective and counsellor. Even if the issue between Saemon and Shaleij has nothing to do with a love crisis but is rather a kidnapping, my companion has solved the first part of the problem perfectly with her interviews. We know that Saemon's old rival Desharik of Brynnlaw is the culprit and Leyala has even managed to keep Saemon from a forceful frontal attack on the island which would only endanger Shaleij.
We need to seek out Nib Jansen and charter his sky ship to reach the formerly dreaded asylum secretly via air.~
@2084 =~A Phalanx of Foe

Our visit to Larloch has provided us with further insight and a strange ally.
The goddess Shar had already visited the Shadow King to win him to her side with the prospect of access to the Shadow Weave. But Mystra could finally convince him to stand by her and the True Weave. However, Larloch is supposed to play a charade on Shar and to meet with her pretending his agreement to her suggestions. We plan to attend this meeting as well - uninvited.
For this reason we are to travel to the meeting place in Wheloon, a town with a Mystra temple that lies east of Mornbryn's Shield and can be reached from that town.
Sandrah is suspicious about that temple already which has been proposed by Shar to meet Larloch and suggests that we explore the place thoroughly ahead of the rendezvous.~
@2085  = ~L'Urieet and Lolth

L'Urieet has been captured by an assassin of the Spider Queen!
Lolth did not accept my companion's choice of a free life away from her domination of the Underdark. During a fierce battle, her assassin Shyntlara has managed with her magic and cohorts to separate L'Urieet from our company and secure her to the Underdark where she is supposed to wait for Lolth's trial.
Shyntlara carelessly mentioned Ust Natha, the drow town we had visited long time ago in pursuit of Irenicus.
Of course we cannot tolerate Lolth's action, even if another powerful enemy is the last thing we need at this time. We cannot leave a companion in peril!~
@2086  = ~L'Urieet and Lolth

Lolth's blind wrath seems to work for us and against herself. L'Urieet's father was the same Captain Egeissag we defeated in Sendai's service once and he was a brother of Imrae, the ruling matron of Ust Natha. Lolth rages against the whole city, she has either killed the citizens or sealed them into their houses. She resides in the temple where she also holds her prisoners.
Sandrah has agreed with Imrae to access the temple with a trick rather than by open force. We are to meet the matron near the temple where she will deliver us as a *sacrifice* to Lolth and thus get us inside.~
@2087 =~The Citadel

We have returned to Thay and it seems with Shar now out of the way it is time to face the heads of the conspiracy directly - Szass Tam and Cyric.
Our target is the legendary Citadel in the Thay Mounts. Nobody knows where it is nor how to access it, other than with the help of Szass Tam himself.

Candrella and Sandrah have a plan to lure the Zulkir out from his hideout by removing his local representative Autharch Ithrash. To prepare the trap for our opponents a bait is needed - Sandrah and myself. The Red Hoods will forge a betrayal and Edwin will try to lead Ithrash out to the estate to capture us.~
@2088 =~Melicamp's Quest

Melicamp's relationship with Thalantyr goes deeper than the *permanent apprentice* was aware of. The old mage cared for the young sorcerer in a way that reminds of Gorion's care for <CHARNAME>. He came to say goodbye to his apprentice when we set out for Thay.
Thalantyr reminded Melicamp to keep a lookout for old Netheril scrolls that may be found in Thay.~
@2089 =~Melicamp's Quest

We found a part of an old Netheril scroll. Sandrah and Melicamp are sure that there is more to be found in the future and they hold a trace of what Thalantyr was referring to when he said goodbye to his apprentice.~
@2090 =~Melicamp's Quest

It seems we found enough old material from Netheril for Sandrah and Melicamp to study and probably reveal some ancient arcane knowledge. We need a peaceful place to rest and research in the near future.~
@2091 =~A Helping Hand

We have the hand that operates the ancient transport system that threatens the Sword Coast and also allows us access to the Citadel. In a clean and painful operation, Sandrah has acted quickly and cold blooded to separate the hand from its former owner Szass Tam.
With the bloody trophy we can make our way to the portal beneath the old Bhaal temple on the Odesseiron estate and from there into the Citadel.~
@2092 =~Melicamp's Quest

The studies of my companions have given us an idea of what treasure of wisdom we might find inside the Citadel - Karsus' Pocket Library, an object containing knowledge greater than any known in Faerun. What Melicamp has in mind is to share this wisdom with everybody else by founding a university for learning and teaching, where each student will find the answers to his specific needs.~
@2093 =~A Revelation

Before our mastermind enemy Cyric once again made his hasted departure from the final battlefield - abandoning his ally Szass Tam behind - he issued another threat. He is not yet defeated, instead it seems that his former lover Midnight may be his next target.~
@2094 =~A Revelation

Cyric captured Midnight, his former lover and the former goddess Mystra. He keeps her as his hostage to exchange her for the essence of Bhaal he thinks is his to own. He seems to be unaware that the essence has long been destroyed and purified to create the new portfolio of Love and Hope, unusable by him.
Sandrah presumes that the place to find him will be Blackstaff Tower, a place on the Sword Coast that is long deserted and last found to be a gnoll stronghold meanwhile.~
